# BlueLightTracker
contains code for an Arduino-Based wearable blue light tracking device

This repository contains code for a wearable blue light tracker I developed using Adafruit's microcontroller and light sensor to properly calculate blue light exposure with research I had done on the proper methods to determine overexposure. THe device has a built in LED light which lets you know of stages of your overexposure.
